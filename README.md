# **March Madness Analysis**
March Madness is an annual college basketball tournament that captivates sports fans all over the United States. Every year, millions of people fill out brackets in an attempt to predict the outcome of the tournament. In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze the March Madness data provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and create a model that can predict the winner of each game in the tournament.

### **Datasets**
Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the following datasets from 2008-2023 *(2020 not included)* will be in this investigation of March Madness:  
> <sub>[Tournament Game Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/Tournament%20Game%20Data.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[Tournament Team Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/Tournament%20Team%20Data.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[Tournament Conference Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/Tournament%20Conference%20Data.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[Upset Count Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/Upset%20Count%20Data.csv)</sub>  

> <sub>[2023 Conference Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/2023%20Conference%20Data.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[2023 Game Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/2023%20Game%20Data.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[2023 Tournament Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/2023%20Tournament%20Data.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[2023 Tournament Trends](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/2023%20Tournament%20Trends.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[Tournament Team Data (Including 2023)](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/Tournament%20Team%20Data%20(Including%202023).csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[Tournament Trends](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/Tournament%20Trends.csv)</sub>  
> <sub>[Unranked Teams Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/CSV/Unranked%20Teams%20Data.csv)</sub>  

The above datasets pulled from [https://kenpom.com/](https://kenpom.com/) & [https://www.barttorvik.com/#](https://www.barttorvik.com/#) are not ideal to analyze with a machine learning model yet. Thus, we initially planned out the relational database we will create with [Quick DBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to help model the data through ERDs conceptually, logically, and physically.

### **March Madness Database with SQL**
Once the dataset CSV files are imported succesfully into a **PostgreSQL** database using **pgAdmin**, we cleaned, organized, and performed initial exploratory data analysis on the pulled March Madness datasets above.
>> ***PostgreSQL** is a database engine that implements SQL standards and listens as a server on a network TCP port to provide its abilities. On the other hand, **pgAdmin** is a graphical user interface administration tool for **PostgreSQL**. Itâ€™s a client that allows you to manipulate schema and data on an instance or multiple instances of PostgreSQL engines.*

Basing the relational database of the imported datasets off our initially diagrammed ERD, we wrote and executed ***SQL queries*** in a query tool with **pgAdmin**:
> [March_Madness.sql]() 

To create tables for building one March Madness **PostgreSQL database**, exported as the CSV files below:
> [Tournament Game Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/)
> [Tournament Team Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/)
> [Tournament Conference Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/)
> [Upset Count Data](https://github.com/smabernathy27/Final_Project/blob/main/)

---

### **Machine Learning**

After exporting these tables as CSV files, the data is ready to be preprocessed. We will then train and evaluate several machine learning models *(including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks)* to understand the trends and patterns in March Madness games.   

After conlusively optimizing the performance of all models, the final results of each model are compared *(including the best performing model and its accuracy)* to select the best model for predicting the outcome of March Madness games.

### **Questions looking to answer:**
- Do higher seeds consistenly perform better?
- Do certain conferences perform better in March Madness?
- How many upsets are there on average in a tournament? Are they're specific seeds or teams with certain kenpom rankings that create the most upsets?
- Can we use these trends to pick a winner or narrow it down significantly?

## Overview of Analysis

### **Extract, Transform, and Load with SQL**
- Data Modeling
- Data Engineering
- Data Analysis

In the [March_Madness.sql](), datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) were used to create a database in **Postgres**. Once we import the initial datasets into **Postgres**, we will be able to create each table for each CSV. These tables will be tailored specifically for the data in each file.
ETL Process:
- Inspect, Extract, and Explore the Data
- Clean and Transform the Datasets
- Data Transformation and CLeaning using Regular Expressions
- Create a Database Scheme and Load the Data
