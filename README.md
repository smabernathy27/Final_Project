# March Madness Analysis
March Madness is an annual college basketball tournament that captivates sports fans all over the United States. Every year, millions of people fill out brackets in an attempt to predict the outcome of the tournament. In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze the March Madness data provided by Kaggle and create a model that can predict the winner of each game in the tournament.

Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the following datasets from 2008-2023 *(2020 not included)* pulled from [https://kenpom.com/](https://kenpom.com/) & [https://www.barttorvik.com/#](https://www.barttorvik.com/#) will be in this investigation of March Madness:

Using these csv files, we will explore and visualize the provided data to understand the trends and patterns in March Madness games. 
>> *The process of **model->fit->predict/transform** follows the same general steps across all of data science:*   
>>  <sub>&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;*i. Decide on a model, and create a model instance  
>>  &ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;ii. Split into training and testing sets, and preprocess the data  
>>  &ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;iii. Train/fit the training data to the model  
>>  &ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;iv. Use the model for predictions and transformations*</sub>  

Once the data is finished preprocessing, we train and evaluate several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to predict the winner of March Madness games. After optimizing the performance of the models, the final results of each model are compared (including the best performing model and its accuracy) to select the best one for predicting the outcome of March Madness games.
